	<p>I worked with Sam Hincks from the beginning to discuss what could be possible with brain stimulation. I was initially intrigued after reading about Dr. Oliver Sacks from NYU stimulating himself for the extra creativity boost.
Thankfully, Sam was already on board with a lot of articles reviews, so we formulated the experiment together. Unfortunately, the amount of time for brain stimulation got a lot shorter than we wanted due to IRB rejecting our initial proposals, but it eventually passed!
Afer running the experiments, we saw that results were significant, but only after 9 minutes of brain stimulation. Because we were only given 10 minutes for this experiment, we had to resort to explaining why our experiment was significant despite only having one minute of significance. </p>
	<p>Thankfully, brainstorming after the experiment got us interested in what could be possible if we use music to stimulate our brain. Music is unique in that it directly manipulates the deeper parts of the brain.
Hence, we met with professors of the psychology department to discuss what the current state-of-arts research in the psychology and decided to head towards non-invasive music as the stimulus for performance enhancement. 
If you are interested in following our experiment, feel free to visit again in a few months! We are utilizing tone.js and magenta developed by Google and web audio API to design our new music experiment.</p>
