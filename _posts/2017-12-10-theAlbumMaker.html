	<p>The project uses Google App Engine, which we wrote in Python to do the storing of images, authentication, and image processing to classify the images by their commonalities, whether that be landmark, dominant features or colors. </p>

	<p>The Color Vision API by Google was certainly a pleasure to use and would recommend it to others for simple image classification!</p>

	<p>Thank you!</p>
