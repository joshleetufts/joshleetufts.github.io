					<h2>Scutellaria Baicalensis in Stroke Management</h2>	
					<p>Experience under <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hocheol_Kim">Professor HoCheol Kim</a></p>

				<hr />
				<p>At Professor Kim's lab, I got to learn the basics of the methods used in a pharmacology lab. The research lab was working on some exciting projects exploring the neuroprotective effects of Scutellaria Baicalensis Georgi, a medicinal plant widely used in traditional Eastern Medicine. </p>
				<p>The research work got <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261771487_Scutellaria_baicalensis_in_stroke_management_Nature%27s_blessing_in_traditional_Eastern_medicine">published</a> after I left and indeed did very well. Getting a hands-on experience was nice, but the main downside was that I didn't learn much other than how to make given drugs from all the ingredients listed in my to-do list. It was hard to feel any ownership of the work. </p>
				<p>After this experience, I looked into getting more experience in research labs where I get more control over the design of the experiment. While it was easy to simply follow given instructions, I wanted to head towards comprehending the task given to me and the implications of the research I am doing. </p>	
				<p>Research at this lab also gave me an interest in pursuing biology and neuroscience, as the terms used in the lab were quite overwhelming. By building upon the basics, I wanted to be part of the team that celebrates the success of research experiments and leave my mark in the research field. </p>
				<p>The <a href="http://kmc.khu.ac.kr/eng/03/01_09.php">department of herbology</a> is still under Professor HoCheol Kim's guidance and publishing many papers each year. </p>
