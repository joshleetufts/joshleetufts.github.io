	<p>The project uses MongoDB and nodeJS for the back end and ReactJS for the front end.</p>

	<p>The user can sign in and post their sublets while also browsing through other options. This is an early prototype that could certainly benefit from a more advanced filtering system.</p>

	<p>Thank you!</p>
