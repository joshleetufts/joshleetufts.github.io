Working under the guidance of [Professor Inah Lee](http://inahlee.org/lab-members/professor-2.html), I got to take part in designing the experiment that I was going to run over the summer. Working with graduate students with engineering degrees, I learned the basics of soldering iron and circuits to help craft the environment for our experiment. However, the hardest part was manually crafting cannulas that we used to place in fluids to manipulate the brain activity of the rat.

Specifically, I worked on the effects of lesioned brain in performing memory tasks inside an 8 arm radial maze. The mouse was trained to favor sweet cereal (fruit loops) over non-sweet cereal (cheerios) and extensive conditional trials were performed to ensure that the rats show this selective behavior. Once they were well trained to select a sweet cereal over non-sweet cereal, we placed them in an 8 arm maze to train them to choose to select sweet cereal over non-sweet cereal by recognizing specific objects to choose the right arm. Once they all showed performance over a specific threshold, their brains were lesioned by using muscimol, a selective agonist for the GABA-A receptor. Then their performance was recorded daily, with different parts being lesioned to see how destroying each subset of the hippocampus influenced the performance of the rat. After, I analyzed the results using excel and concluded the summer project. 

The working conditions were a lot harder than what I was used to, but it was a great introduction experience to working culture in Korea. While working 80 hours a week was not an easy task, the time spent with the graduate students and getting to listen to their perspectives helped me become more mature about my approach to life. I also developed professionalism and independence to successfully do my part in the research project. Daily handling of the rats and ensuring that all the equipments and housing used by the rats were in pristine condition throughout the experiment resulted in none of the rats getting sick and performing worse throughout the experiment. 

The experience was gratifying and it was good to connect with graduate students who I still contact today. Because the research project confirmed that the parts of the dorsal and ventral hippocampus had effects that were different from what we expected in the hypothesis, the project ended unpublished. However, their drive to continue exploring despite its difficulties have been inspiring and I look forward to seeing this project on get published soon!
