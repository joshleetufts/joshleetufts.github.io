				<p>After a semester of taking biology at Tufts, I was intrigued to pursue pharmacological studies at Tufts as well. After a few meetings, I got to join<a href="http://sackler.tufts.edu/Faculty-and-Research/Faculty-Profiles/Klaus-Miczek-Profile">Professor Miczek's lab</a> to research the effects of social stress on a rat's drug abuse behavior. I got to learn about the behavioral, physiological and neuropharmacological research strategies to study how cocaine intake could vary according to the schedule cocaine is given to the rats.</p>
				<p>Specifically, I got to investigate the role of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) in mediating the stress-induced emergence of addictive-like behaviors. Because rats are not naturally inclined to enjoy cocaine, we must control conditions for the mouse to show addictive behaviors.</p>
				<p>We wanted to see the rat display addictive behavior so that we can see the changes in CRF level. This would help us understand how addictive behaviors come about and which areas we could target with antagonists to prevent addictive behaviors.</p>
				<p>While I couldn't get a publication during my time here, I certainly enjoyed my time at the lab and getting to know Professor Klaus Miczek. He is my first research mentor that helped me start my journey engaging in all different types of research at Tufts.</p>
				<p>I have also taken every undergraduate and graduate classes he has taught at Tufts and much credit goes to him for giving me a sharp eye to always be skeptical and be inquisitive when exposed to new research findings.</p>
