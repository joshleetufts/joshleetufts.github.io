		<p>A project launched by Graham Goudeau and maintained by the Tufts Community</p>

	<p>The project uses Typescript for the back end and Webpack for the front end to make the service accessible for students. We store the student's information in MongoDB so that we can know how they can be reached, from where they would like to be picked up and at what time.</p>

	<p>The project is still in need of a front end that is more pleasing and easy to use for the user. Currently, I am learning how to use front end tools to make a lot of contributions in that area. If you have any comments on how this project could be more useful or features that you think we should add, please contact me!</p>

	<p>Thank you!</p>
