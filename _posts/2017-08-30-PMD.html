		<p>A project launched by the Jumbo code team</p>

	<p>The project uses MongoDB and nodeJS for the backend, Angular for the front end desktop and ionic for the mobile front end. </p>

	<p>The app facilitates the check-in and check-out process for volunteers and notifies them about their roles and where they should be during their shifts. Hence, it has a back end that processes the data, front end desktop for the administrator to edit the information, and the front end mobile that displays the most up-to-date information to the volunteers.</p>

	<p>Thank you!</p>
