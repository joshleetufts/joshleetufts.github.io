	&lt;hr /&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The project uses Google App Engine, which we wrote in Python to do the storing of images, authentication, and image processing to classify the images by their commonalities, whether that be landmark, dominant features or colors. &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The Color Vision API by Google was certainly a pleasure to use and would recommend it to others for simple image classification!&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Currently under progress&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;A project launched by the Jumbo code team&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/header&gt;
	
	&lt;hr /&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The project uses MongoDB and nodeJS for the backend, Angular for the front end desktop and ionic for the mobile front end. &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The app facilitates the check-in and check-out process for volunteers and notifies them about their roles and where they should be during their shifts. Hence, it has a back end that processes the data, front end desktop for the administrator to edit the information, and the front end mobile that displays the most up-to-date information to the volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>First publication at Physiological Computing Systems</title>

	&lt;header&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;Towards Bidirectional Brain-Computer Interfaces that use fNIRS and tDCS&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;First personal publication at Tufts University&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/header&gt;
	&lt;hr /&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;I worked with Sam Hincks from the beginning to discuss what could be possible with brain stimulation. I was initially intrigued after reading about Dr. Oliver Sacks from NYU stimulating himself for the extra creativity boost.
Thankfully, Sam was already on board with a lot of articles reviews, so we formulated the experiment together. Unfortunately, the amount of time for brain stimulation got a lot shorter than we wanted due to IRB rejecting our initial proposals, but it eventually passed!
Afer running the experiments, we saw that results were significant, but only after 9 minutes of brain stimulation. Because we were only given 10 minutes for this experiment, we had to resort to explaining why our experiment was significant despite only having one minute of significance. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, brainstorming after the experiment got us interested in what could be possible if we use music to stimulate our brain. Music is unique in that it directly manipulates the deeper parts of the brain.
Hence, we met with professors of the psychology department to discuss what the current state-of-arts research in the psychology and decided to head towards non-invasive music as the stimulus for performance enhancement. 
If you are interested in following our experiment, feel free to visit again in a few months! We are utilizing tone.js and magenta developed by Google and web audio API to design our new music experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;hr /&gt;
	
	&lt;h5&gt; Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jacob/papers/hincks.tdcs.phycs17.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to the paper.&lt;/h5&gt;

	&lt;/header&gt;
	
	&lt;hr /&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The project uses MongoDB and nodeJS for the back end and ReactJS for the front end.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The user can sign in and post their sublets while also browsing through other options. This is an early prototype that could certainly benefit from a more advanced filtering system.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/header&gt;
	
	&lt;hr /&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The project uses Typescript for the back end and Webpack for the front end to make the service accessible for students. We store the student's information in MongoDB so that we can know how they can be reached, from where they would like to be picked up and at what time.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The project is still in need of a front end that is more pleasing and easy to use for the user. Currently, I am learning how to use front end tools to make a lot of contributions in that area. If you have any comments on how this project could be more useful or features that you think we should add, please contact me!&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Summer Internship at AnyFi</title>
        <description>Working under the guidance of [Professor Inah Lee](http://inahlee.org/lab-members/professor-2.html), I got to take part in designing the experiment that I was going to run over the summer. Working with graduate students with engineering degrees, I learned the basics of soldering iron and circuits to help craft the environment for our experiment. However, the hardest part was manually crafting cannulas that we used to place in fluids to manipulate the brain activity of the rat.

Specifically, I worked on the effects of lesioned brain in performing memory tasks inside an 8 arm radial maze. The mouse was trained to favor sweet cereal (fruit loops) over non-sweet cereal (cheerios) and extensive conditional trials were performed to ensure that the rats show this selective behavior. Once they were well trained to select a sweet cereal over non-sweet cereal, we placed them in an 8 arm maze to train them to choose to select sweet cereal over non-sweet cereal by recognizing specific objects to choose the right arm. Once they all showed performance over a specific threshold, their brains were lesioned by using muscimol, a selective agonist for the GABA-A receptor. Then their performance was recorded daily, with different parts being lesioned to see how destroying each subset of the hippocampus influenced the performance of the rat. After, I analyzed the results using excel and concluded the summer project. 

The working conditions were a lot harder than what I was used to, but it was a great introduction experience to working culture in Korea. While working 80 hours a week was not an easy task, the time spent with the graduate students and getting to listen to their perspectives helped me become more mature about my approach to life. I also developed professionalism and independence to successfully do my part in the research project. Daily handling of the rats and ensuring that all the equipments and housing used by the rats were in pristine condition throughout the experiment resulted in none of the rats getting sick and performing worse throughout the experiment. 

The experience was gratifying and it was good to connect with graduate students who I still contact today. Because the research project confirmed that the parts of the dorsal and ventral hippocampus had effects that were different from what we expected in the hypothesis, the project ended unpublished. However, their drive to continue exploring despite its difficulties have been inspiring and I look forward to seeing this project on get published soon!

        <title>Research at Tufts Psychopharmacology Lab</title>
        <description>			&lt;section&gt;

					&lt;h2&gt;The effect of intermittent and continuous access on binge behavior &lt;/h2&gt;	
					&lt;p&gt;Role of corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) in the relationship between social stress and cocaine self-administration&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;/header&gt;
				&lt;hr /&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;After a semester of taking biology at Tufts, I was intrigued to pursue pharmacological studies at Tufts as well. After a few meetings, I got to join&lt;a href=&quot;http://sackler.tufts.edu/Faculty-and-Research/Faculty-Profiles/Klaus-Miczek-Profile&quot;&gt;Professor Miczek's lab&lt;/a&gt; to research the effects of social stress on a rat's drug abuse behavior. I got to learn about the behavioral, physiological and neuropharmacological research strategies to study how cocaine intake could vary according to the schedule cocaine is given to the rats.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Specifically, I got to investigate the role of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) in mediating the stress-induced emergence of addictive-like behaviors. Because rats are not naturally inclined to enjoy cocaine, we must control conditions for the mouse to show addictive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;We wanted to see the rat display addictive behavior so that we can see the changes in CRF level. This would help us understand how addictive behaviors come about and which areas we could target with antagonists to prevent addictive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;While I couldn't get a publication during my time here, I certainly enjoyed my time at the lab and getting to know Professor Klaus Miczek. He is my first research mentor that helped me start my journey engaging in all different types of research at Tufts.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;I have also taken every undergraduate and graduate classes he has taught at Tufts and much credit goes to him for giving me a sharp eye to always be skeptical and be inquisitive when exposed to new research findings.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;For further publications in his lab, please reference this &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=GDNokaYAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
